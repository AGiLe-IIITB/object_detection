1.
python cnn_face_encoder.py -i ./vdos/krishna.mp4 -m ./mmod_human_face_detector.dat -e ./encodings/krishna.pickle -d ./faceDump/krishna

the above is used to detect faces and dump frames containing faces into the faceDump folder (u will have to manually create the folder in which u want to save the frames, in this case it is called as krishna)
and the pickle is created which contains the comnined version of each frame's boxes and 128 face encodings of each box (face)

this code was partially taken from cnn_face_encoder from dlib's github and pyImageSearch
the face detection part is from dlib and the dump abd pickle making part is from pyImageSearch
we didnt use pyImageSearch entirely because that wanted input of images of each person into a separate folder and then would create pickle file out from that and we didnt want that

2.
python clusterFaces.py -e encodings/krishna.pickle -d 1 -o encodings/krishna-clustered.pickle

is used to group similar faces together and create another pickle file called clustered pickle

3.
python3 cnnFaceComperator.py -i vdos/krishna-isl.mp4 -m mmod_human_face_detector.dat -e encodings/krishna-clustered.pickle

used to detect faces in the new vdo and try matching them with the already available face encodng details in the cluster pickle
